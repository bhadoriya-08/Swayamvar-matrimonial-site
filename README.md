Swayamvar â€“ Matrimonial Web Application

Swayamvar is a modern matrimonial web application built using React and Firebase. It provides a smooth and user-friendly experience for individuals looking to find compatible life partners online. The platform allows users to create profiles, search for matches based on filters such as gender, age, religion, caste, and income, and communicate through a built-in chat system.

The main features of Swayamvar include user authentication, profile creation, gender-based and filter-based search, real-time chat using Firebase Firestore, like and match functionality, and a premium chat system. Users can chat for free for the first five messages, after which they are prompted to make a payment to continue chatting. Once payment is successful, chatting resumes without any limit.

The application is built using React for the frontend, Firebase Firestore for the database, Firebase Authentication for login and registration, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications. The design uses clean CSS styling for a smooth and responsive interface. Payment functionality can be integrated through Razorpay or any other payment gateway.
The project includes several main pages: a Home page for navigation, Login and Register pages for authentication, a Search page for finding matches based on filters, a Matches page displaying compatible profiles, a Chat page for real-time messaging, and a Payment section that appears when users reach the free chat limit.

The folder structure is organized into components such as Navbar, ChatPage, Search, Matches, Notifications, Login, and Register. Each component handles a specific functionality of the application, ensuring modular and maintainable code.

Future improvements planned for Swayamvar include integration of a real payment gateway like Razorpay or Stripe, the addition of video and voice chat options, AI-based compatibility scoring, and profile verification features.
